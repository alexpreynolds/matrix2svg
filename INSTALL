Basic Installation
==================

Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package. If there is no ./configure
script, use the following commands to populate the package with the 
required Makefile and dependent configuration files:

$ aclocal
$ autoheader
$ automake --add-missing
$ autoconf

When running ./configure, if you would like to build the debug version,
add the "--enable-debug" option. This adds the requisite debug flags and 
optimization level settings to build statements.
